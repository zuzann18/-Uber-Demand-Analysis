# Uber Demand Analysis

##  Project Overview
This project analyzes Uber ride demand in New York City, identifying key factors influencing ride pickups. The goal is to extract actionable insights that can help Uber optimize its operations based on weather conditions, holidays, and location-based trends.

## Objectives
- Identify variables influencing Uber ride pickups.
- Determine the most significant factors affecting demand.
- Provide recommendations for Uber management to capitalize on demand fluctuations.

## Dataset Description
The dataset consists of various features related to time, weather, and demand. The key columns include:

- **pickup_dt**: Date and time of the pick-up.
- **borough**: NYC borough.
- **pickups**: Number of pickups in a given period.
- **spd**: Wind speed (mph).
- **vsb**: Visibility (miles).
- **temp**: Temperature (°F).
- **dewp**: Dew point (°F).
- **slp**: Sea level pressure.
- **pcp01**: 1-hour liquid precipitation.
- **pcp06**: 6-hour liquid precipitation.
- **pcp24**: 24-hour liquid precipitation.
- **sd**: Snow depth (inches).
- **hday**: Holiday indicator (Y/N).

## 📊 Key Findings

### 1️⃣ Influence of Weather
- **Temperature** has a significant positive correlation with ride demand. **Higher temperatures lead to more Uber rides.**
- **Precipitation (rain & snow)** negatively impacts pickups. **Bad weather reduces demand due to reduced mobility.**
- **Visibility** is also a factor—low visibility conditions reduce demand.

### 2️⃣ Effect of Holidays & Time of Day
- **Holidays show a clear increase in Uber usage**, likely due to increased travel and reduced availability of public transport.
- **Peak demand is observed in the evening hours**, especially between 5 PM - 10 PM.
- **Weekends** see a significant **increase in demand** compared to weekdays.

### 3️⃣ Borough-Wise Demand
- **Manhattan has the highest Uber pickup volume.** This is expected due to its high population density and business activity.
- **Brooklyn and Queens show moderate demand**, but it fluctuates more with weather conditions.
- **The Bronx and Staten Island have lower overall demand.**

---

## 📌 Recommendations
Based on these findings, we propose the following business strategies:

### 🚀 Dynamic Pricing & Driver Allocation
- Implement **surge pricing based on real-time weather and holiday data** to optimize revenue.
- Increase **driver availability in high-demand areas during peak times** (evenings, weekends, and holidays).
- Reduce driver allocation in **low-visibility conditions or heavy rainfall**, as demand tends to drop.

### 📍 Location-Based Adjustments
- Focus **marketing efforts on outer boroughs (Brooklyn, Queens)** to improve demand in those regions.
- Increase **Manhattan coverage** during peak evening hours to maximize trip efficiency.

### 📈 Service Enhancements
- Offer **incentives to drivers** for working in high-demand periods.
- **Introduce promotions for rides booked in bad weather**, encouraging more usage even during low-mobility conditions.

---

## 📜 Conclusion
This analysis reveals that **weather, holidays, and borough location significantly impact Uber ride demand.** By leveraging these insights, Uber can implement strategic pricing, optimize driver availability, and enhance user experience. 

Applying **data-driven strategies** can lead to increased efficiency, better customer satisfaction, and higher revenue.
